# Vehicle Count Prediction
As part of our course project for CSN-382(Machine Learning) at IIT Roorkee, we implemented several existing machine learning and deep learning algorithms for Vehicle Count Prediction. We comprehensively compared and analysed
our results using metrics like RMSE, MAE and MSE. We proposed a new model named JV2Former (based on our names initial letters) and it demonstrated performance more than 10X better wrt MAE with the next best performing model.
In this repository we make available the code of all the models we tried out with timeframes of 1 day, 2 days etc as the windows for predicting the next observation. All of them are provided as Jupyter Notebooks for better 
visualization and interactive code.
